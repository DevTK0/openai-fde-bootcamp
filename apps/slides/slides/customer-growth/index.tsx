A boarding cannot automatically be multiplied by an assumed fare.\n\nSource: Journey and passenger queue records · 5 to 16 Oct 2026.\nScope: Supplied operating and passenger reports only. All figures are fictional exercise data, not live business results.",
  "The records show over two million boardings.\n\nThe complete operating extract has 2,048,591 boarding events across 6,900 trips and 252,380 stop visits. Repeat travel and transfers may count the same person multiple times. There is no payment or customer-identity field linking these events to customer acquisition.\n\nInterpretation: Repeated travel and transfers count again; boarding events do not reveal new customers or earnings.\n\nSource: Journey and passenger queue records · 5 to 16 Oct 2026.\nScope: Supplied operating and passenger reports only.

  "One passenger gave up waiting.\n\nThis is a concrete sign of friction before completing a journey. The same report set also includes a person who waited for the next bus and someone whose changed bus ran as expected.
